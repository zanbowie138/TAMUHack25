The 2024 Toyota Camry's safety features are outstanding. The pre-collision system worked flawlessly.
Toyota's hybrid system in the RAV4 is incredibly efficient, consistently getting 40+ MPG.
The Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist on my Highlander is a game changer.
Love the reliability of Toyota vehicles. My Corolla has 200k miles and still running strong.
The infotainment system could use some work, but Toyota Safety Sense makes up for it.
