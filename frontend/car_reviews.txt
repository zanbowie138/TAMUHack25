The lane departure warning system is amazing! It's saved me from drifting multiple times.
I love the automatic emergency braking. It prevented a potential accident last week.
The blind spot monitoring works well, but the beeping can be annoying sometimes.
The adaptive cruise control is a game changer for highway driving.
The parking sensors are okay, but they're too sensitive and beep constantly.
The rear cross-traffic alert has been incredibly helpful in busy parking lots.
